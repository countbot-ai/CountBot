## What Is CountBot

CountBot is a lightweight AI agent framework that better fits Chinese users' habits, and also a runtime hub built for local deployment and long-running operation.

It connects roles, teams, workflows, tool invocation, memory, LLMs, IM channels, and local workspaces so AI can run continuously, collaborate across entry points, and execute real tasks.

You can think of CountBot as both a framework and a hub:

- Upward, it connects to 100+ LLM providers and different model strategies
- Outward, it connects to Web, WeChat, Lark, DingTalk, Telegram, Discord, QQ, Weibo, and more
- Inward, it organizes roles, teams, workflows, memory, and security boundaries
- At the execution layer, it connects files, Shell, Web, screenshots, file transfer, and external professional tools such as Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode

In one sentence: **CountBot is an AI agent framework and runtime hub that connects models, channels, teams, and tools.**

CountBot was born from natural language. Its vision is not to require more people to learn complex configuration and programming before they can use AI, but to let ordinary users interact with AI directly through natural language to retrieve information, generate content, break down tasks, call tools, orchestrate workflows, and even build their own assistants, team collaboration flows, and automation systems.

## Why CountBot

CountBot starts from the broader trend of software being driven by natural language, and aims to let AI truly land in real tasks and everyday work.

Software development and software usage are changing:
1. Interaction between people and software is moving from complex commands and code toward natural language.
2. Tools and systems are moving from standardized products toward a future where more people can define and create personalized tools.

The core challenge for AI agents is no longer just model capability alone. It is how to combine LLMs, tool invocation, multi-channel access, permission boundaries, and long-running operation into a system that can actually be deployed and maintained.

OpenClaw has already validated a viable path for local execution and autonomous agents. On top of that, CountBot focuses on filling key gaps in **Chinese scenario adaptation, lightweight deployment, usability expansion, security control, and governance**.

CountBot is not merely a conversational AI application. It is open infrastructure for real tasks: deployable, extensible, and governable, so ordinary users can use natural language to drive AI, organize tools, connect channels, and actually land business and daily workflows.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Start From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/countbot-ai/CountBot.git
cd CountBot

# Default installation
pip install -r requirements.txt

# If you are in mainland China, you can use the Aliyun mirror
pip install -r requirements.txt -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/

python start_app.py
```

After startup, CountBot opens at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` by default.

You can override the default bind host and port with environment variables. Priority is `COUNTBOT_HOST` / `COUNTBOT_PORT` > defaults.

```powershell
$env:COUNTBOT_HOST = '0.0.0.0'
$env:COUNTBOT_PORT = '8001'
python start_app.py
```

```cmd
set COUNTBOT_HOST=0.0.0.0
set COUNTBOT_PORT=8001
python start_app.py
```

If GitHub access is limited, you can switch to Gitee:

```bash
git clone https://gitee.com/countbot-ai/CountBot.git
```
